 * the adapter and is used internally to configure the Adafruit_PN532 driver accordingly.

 * @brief Adapter class wrapping the Adafruit_PN532 library.
 *
 * PN532Adapter provides a unified interface conforming to NFCDriver,
 * abstracting the underlying hardware interface. This allows higher-level
 * code (like CryptnoxWallet) to operate independently of whether the
 * PN532 module is connected via SPI, I2C, or UART.
 *
 * The adapter handles initialization, UID reading, APDU communication,
 * passive target detection, firmware info retrieval, and reader reset.
